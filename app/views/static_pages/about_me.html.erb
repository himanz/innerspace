Welcome to Jonathan Chang's pet project.  I am a web developer in Toronto, Canada.  
In the past I have worked on the pilot projects with Google that have turned out to be
what is now known as Google Business View and Street View for businesses.  Here are a few
news article from when I was working with the project.

Working on these projects was a great experience and I visited a lot of great locations
in Eastern Canada.  However, I realize that not many people know about these features of
Street View in that you can now view certain businesses and tourist attractions outdoors as well as 
indoors.  

I built this website to document about the businesses and special locations that have been Street Viewed
so that other people can enjoy visiting locations around the world.

If you are a business owner and want Street View done to your indoors, I can help you with the process to get
it done.  Just contact me at my details below.

If you work for a special location like a tourist attraction, university, college, park, etc. and want Street View
done for your outdoor, contact me and I can help you with the process to get it approved.
